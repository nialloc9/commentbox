# commentbox
This is a commentbox system that can be used for customer feedback or can be used for any task that the user needs to comment for. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, jQuery, and PHP.
In index.php on line 4 I have added a variable $user_id for an example but change this to what you require. Also you will need to change the connect file at sql/connect.php. You
will then need to change the queries that are being used here to ones that connect to your database.

If you are the user who created the comment an x will appear in the top right hand corner of the comment which enables you to delete the comment.

Please look at the screenshot folder to see screenshots of this project working.
